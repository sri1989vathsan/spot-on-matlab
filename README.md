# Downloading and Running Spot-On Matlab
This repository contains the Matlab version of Spot-On. The Matlab
version is distributed with the GNU GPL v3 license. Please
download the entire repository as a zipped-file and then open up the
introductory guide "A step-by-step guide to using Spot-On MatLab
version 1.docx" and follow the instructions in there.
Alternatively, if you download the repository and open up the main
script "SpotOn_main.m" and click run, the whole code should run and
produce a series of plots based on the example data.


Update 2017-07-26
Fixed plotting issue on small screen. Enabled weighting: if
UseWeights=1, Spot-On will now weigh each histogram at each dT
according to the relative amount of data in the least-squares
fitting.
